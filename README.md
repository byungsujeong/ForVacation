# Challenges
I had an experience of MVC2 design pattern through Spring Framework. However this project was MVC1 design which does not include controller as java beans. This pattern was a bit difficult because I was used to MVC2. Through this project, I could make sure the differences between mvc1 and mvc2 accurately.
Also, For asynchronous processing, I tried to utilize ajax. To implement ajax on my project, i had to understand about the Xml httpRequest object. This knowledge will shed some light on my thought process.
